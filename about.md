# About the Artist

I’m [Artist’s Name], a local painter serving Huntersville and the greater Charlotte area. I specialize in durable, eye-catching rock paintings — from birthday celebrations to school spirit and custom yard art.

## Story & Inspiration
What began as helping friends and neighbors celebrate milestones became a full-time passion. I love turning simple stones into memorable statements for your home, school, or community.

## Style
Clean typography, bright color palettes, and weather-resistant finishes. I use professional-grade outdoor paints and sealants so your rock looks great for months.

## Service Area
Huntersville, Cornelius, Davidson, and Charlotte, NC.
